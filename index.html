        <h3>My Journey:</h3>
            <p>
                Middle School - 
                My artistic journey began in middle school (7-8th Grade). I was accepted into my school
                district's fine arts accademy known as the North Valley Arts Accademy. Here, I began 
                Learning the basics for art. - I was introduced to new vocabulary, mediums, and art styles. 
                The assignments I did in class were structured and planned by my teacher, who was wonderful
                at teaching us individually!
            </p>

            <p>
                High School - 
                Once I entered high school, I began to build off of the artistic foundation I had gained in 
                middle school. Now, I was given more artistic liberty in class, often times deciding what projects
                to take on in my preferred medium. It was during these four years that I developed my love for 
                acrylic paint. I also learned to enjoy painting landscapes based off of photos I had taken. By
                photographing my own reference photos, I was able to claim full ownership of my
                final paintings.
